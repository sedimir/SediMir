### Hi there 👋
Welcome to my website! My name is Sedi, and I'm a data enthusiast with a keen interest in energy. Through this platform, I aim to demonstrate the practical applications of data analytics in optimizing energy projects through the following examples: 

1. Using Data Analytics to Manage a Solar Power Plant (in progress)
2. Data Wrangling and Feature Engineering for Energy Datasets (coming soon)
3. Machine Learning and Power Generation Forcasting (coming soon) 


While my page is currently a work in progress, I am excited to share my insights on how data analysis can help achieve greater project efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the renewable energy sector.

Stay tuned for more updates, as I continue to expand on my areas of expertise and provide real-world examples of how data analytics can be utilized to improve energy projects.
