### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my page! My name is Sedi, and I'm a data enthusiast with a keen interest in renewable energy. Through this platform, I aim to demonstrate the practical applications of data analytics in optimizing energy projects through the following examples: 

1. [Using Data Analytics to Manage a Solar Power Plant](https://github.com/sedimir/SediMir/blob/main/solar-power-generation.ipynb)
2. [Machine Learning and Power Generation Forcasting ] (https://github.com/sedimir/SediMir/blob/main/machine-learning-forecasting-power-generation.ipynb))


While my page is currently a work in progress, I am excited to share my insights on how data analysis can help achieve greater project efficiency and cost-effectiveness in the renewable energy sector.

Stay tuned for more updates, as I continue to expand on my areas of expertise and provide real-world examples of how data analytics can be utilized to improve energy projects.
